  Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Ruben
Software developer student from Barcelona. Passionate about computing since the days of floppy disks, always working with them, assembling, understanding computers, and networks. I trained in vocational training in DB2, COBOL, and later in object-oriented programming languages. My skills since then have primarily been in analysis, curiosity, and enhancing and solving daily work problems. Now, I am resuming my programming experience with C and Linux at the 42 Barcelona programming campus of FundaciÃ³n TelefÃ³nica.
